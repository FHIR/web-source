title: FHIR Report for August 2017 
---

<p>
July and August are relatively quiet months for the FHIR community, with the northern hemisphere trying to enjoy what passes for summer lately. 
But Some interesting things still happened.
</p>
<p>
<b>Meetings
</b></p>
<p>
The most important meeting was AMIA in China. HL7 China organised a Connectathon beforehand, which was supported by David Hay
HL7 China reports:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
HL7 China held a connectathon during the recent CHIMA conference. It was a half day event after a seminar presented by David Hay. There were a number of Use Cases tested:
</p>
<ul>
<li>RESTful Create/Read operations against Patient</li>
<li>RESTful Create/Read operations against Condition</li>
<li>RESTful Create/Read operations using DiagnosticReport resources (with associated dependent resources) </li>
</ul>
<p>
All scenarios had basic data supplied and sample XML resources. 9 companies (with about 25 individuals) were present on the day. 7 of those companies were able to complete all the test scenarios.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>FHIR Foundation</b>
</p>
<p>
The FHIR foundation is starting to produce outcomes. The most important outcomes:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the website is now ready for member services </li>
<li> registry.fhir.org is ready to be announced</li>
<li> there is starting to be member content on http://fhir.org</li>
</ul>
<p>
These will be announced at the HL7 meeting in San Diego
</p>
<p>
<b>Implementation Guides/Projects</b>
</p>
<p>
Implementation Guide production has continued across many countries, with more investment in earlier stages of the tooling starting to occur. 
FHIR Management Group is starting to plan a tutorial stream for producing FHIR Implementation Guides. The tooling to support implementation 
guides is starting to fall into place. We now have editors for 
</p>
<ul>
<li>StructureDefinition</li>
<li>ValueSet</li>
<li>CodeSystem</li>
<li>CapabilityStatement</li>
</ul>
<p>
StructureDefinition editing is via <a href="https://fhir.furore.com/forge/">Forge</a> while the others are edited using the <a href="http://www.healthintersections.com.au/FhirServer/">FHIR Toolkit</a>
</p>
<p>
<b>Planning</b>
</p>
<p>
The September connectathon is an unusually significant - there are many new streams, or streams that 
are making substantial progress, and a lot of development has occurred in the lead up to the connectathon.
</p>
<p>
Quick Status Analysis:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Normative : Need to plan January connectathon around normative</li>
<li>RDF : no progress</li>
<li>Data Analytics - Substantial progress coming at the behest of US ONC</li>
<li>Graph API - Socialising this in the community</li>
<li>Patterns - no further progress</li>
<li>Services - no further progress</li>
<li>Deployment: Smart-On-FHIR ballot is open</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Collaborations</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Snomed Intl: This has stalled due to lack of funding</li>
<li>W3C: Slow progress on RDF - should push for a report at Sept WGM</li>
<li>CDISC: some Initial FHIR Resource to CDISC CDASH mappings were distributed to the Clinical Resource Connectathon track, and will be tested in San Diego</li>
<li>OpenMHealth: Will be attending the San Diego Connectathon</li>
<li>AMA: Still waiting for some traction on this</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Open Issues</b>
</p>
<p>
Internal infrastructure: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>replacing gForge with Jira - A full report on implications has been prepared and reviewed, and this is now in progress (yay!)</li>
<li>replace gForge subversion with Github is under way. </li>
</ul>
<p>
(Both changes will be significant, and particularly the change to GitHub will make a lot of noise as we build out new processes around content management)
</p>
<p>
Version Management - the community has asked us to do more work on inter-version management. Currently there are 2 streams of work:
</p>
<ul>
<li>FGB to describe our goals with regard to inter-version support - this has been done</li>
<li>me to write up the current state of inter-version support in FHIR. This is still to do, and is a significant issue </li>
</p>
<p>
  Smart on FHIR - was balloted. No longer an open issue 
</p>
<p>
  CQL specification family - in progress
</p>
