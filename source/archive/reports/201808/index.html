title: FHIR Foundation Monthly report for July/August 2018
---

<h2>Ballot</h2>
<p>
First of all, apologies for not reporting at the end of July - this was right in the 
middle of preparing for the publishing the FHIR R4 Ballot #2, which was our biggest 
editorial effort yet. The ballot is now open - along with 14 different implementation 
guides. 
</p>
<p>
This is the last ballot for R4. The way the normative balloting works under HL7/ANSI 
rules is that we can't make substantive changes to the specification - that is, 
anything that would impact on specifications - without reballoting, and we won't be 
reballoting before we publish R4 on schedule at the end of this year. Balloting this 
round is limited to the changes that were made between this ballot and the last ballot. 
Each substantive change that was made is listed on the ballot introduction page:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/ballot-intro.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/ballot-intro.html</a>
</p>
<p>
If we don't get consensus from the HL7 balloters to the changes we made, we'll drop the 
relevant sections of R4 back to Trial Use and publish anyway.
</p>
<p>
Many individuals and committees worked really hard and/or effectively to produce the 
ballot ready version of FHIR. It's hard, from outside the process, to appreciate just 
how much work goes into the specification, but we processed over a 1000 ballot comments 
and editorial changes covering things such as typos, and html style issues all the way 
through to some major changes to identifying URLs. We'll be working to update the 
contributer list when we publish the R4 final specification but the list is so long now 
that it's hard to know what do with it: FHIR is a big community.
</p>
<h3>Ongoing comments to the ballot </h3>
<p>
Ballot sign up is now closed - if you have issues that you feel needs to have the weight 
of a ballot comment, but you aren't signed up for the ballot you may be able to find a 
balloter who will take you issue on board. Note that this means that they'll represent 
you issue in an ongoing fashion. If you'd like help finding someone, contact me privately 
(at <a href="mailto:fhir-director@hl7.org">fhir-director@hl7.org</a>).
</p>
<h2>FHIR Foundation Projects and Implementation Guides</h2>
<p>
The FHIR foundation publishes a few implementation guides directly - see:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/">http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/pd/">http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/pd/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/pd/">http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/scheduling/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/pd/">http://www.fhir.org/guides/hspc/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Several more are on the way. The FHIR foundation will also publish other IGs, using the 
following rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the IG must not be developed as an HL7 standards project (HL7 will publish those)</li>
<li>the request to publish must come from a FHIR Foundation member</li>
<li>the IG must be published under and open source license (creative commons, or a license from <a href="http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/pd/">https://opensource.org/</a>)</li>
<li>the governance and processes for maintinaing the content going forward must be clear (including how implementers report issues or propose changes)</li>
<li>The guide must meet some technical requirements - see <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Implementation_Guide_Publishing_Requirements#HL7.2FFHIR_Foundation_Requirements">the HL7 Wiki</a></li>
</ul>
  
<p>
FHIR Foundation members can request this by emailing me at fhir-director@hl7.org.

<h3>New Project: Analytics</h3>

<p>
We are working on creating the first formal FHIR foundation project around the area of 
FHIR data analytics support. This is appropriately a FHIR foundation project not an HL7 
project because there seems to be no intent to produce specifications, but rather white 
papers around implementation techniques. The group is meeting regularly and you can 
track/join progress here:

</p>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
Note: there's events that cover or mention FHIR all the time now - I can barely keep with 
the mentions in social media etc. It's really the case that any conference anywhere in 
the world about health IT will cover FHIR to some degree or other now. Here I mainly focus 
on events focused on FHIR itself, or that were attended by one of the editors of the core 
FHIR Modules. 
</p>
<h3>OpenHIE (Africa) </h3>
</p>
<p>
OpenHIE held their first "HackConnectathon" in Arusha, Tanzania and Bryn Rhodes attended on 
behalf of the FHIR team (thanks for squeezing family holiday time to do this), and provided 
the following report:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  FHIR was a big part of the event. The event was organized similar to a FHIR 
  Connectathon with multiple tracks focused on different areas of the OpenHIE 
  ecosystem. Several of the tracks ran scenarios that involved FHIR directly:
</p>
<p>
  The OpenHIM track, among other scenarios, build a "mediator" (integration 
  connector) that transforms ADX (an IHE profile for aggregate data reporting) 
  messages to a FHIR MeasureReport. At the end of the track, the mediator was 
  functional but needs polish, and could also serve as a template for mediators 
  to converts other types of messages to/from FHIR.
</p>
<p>
  The OpenLMIS track added the HEARTH (open source NodeJS FHIR Server) server 
  as a microservice within the OpenLMIS microservice architecture, and built 
  a script to transform API endpoints that allows them to have the 
  representation of facilities on a FHIR server.
</p>
<p>
  The Intro to OpenHIE track began as an introduction to FHIR and Docker, 
  and ended up as a massive educational learning and sharing academy.
</p>
<p>
  The ADX on FHIR track looked specifically at representing a particular ADX 
  IHE profile for HIV public health indicators in the FHIR Measure and 
  MeasureReport resources. The track worked with the authors of the IHE 
  profile to express the HIV contents using terminologies developed with 
  Apelon as well as a CQL library and a FHIR Measure to represent the HIV 
  indicators.
</p>
<p>
  All in all it was a very successful event, and the OpenHIE community is 
  enthusiastically looking forward to another one!

<h3>CMS Blue Button 2.0 Developer Conference </h3>
<p>
This was in Washington, and Josh Mandel attended and reported on this one:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  On August 13, the CMS Blue Button 2.0 team convened the first-ever 
  Blue Button 2.0 Developer Conference at the Eisenhower Executive Office 
  Building on the White House grounds. Blue Button 2.0 is a CMS initiative 
  to put health care claims data in the hands of over 50M Medicare 
  beneficiaries, building on FHIR and OAuth 2.0 to allow for seamless 
  sharing with apps of the consumer's choice. CMS Administrator Seema Verma 
  opened up the meeting with a forceful and personal reminder about the 
  importance of consumer access to enable data portability and better individual 
  opportunities to seek high-value care. We heard from members of the CMS team 
  who presented on the motivations, the business processes, and the technology 
  behind the Blue Button 2.0 API, and we heard from app developers who are 
  beginning to use this API in diverse use cases including personal health 
  apps, research participation, and insurance coverage shopping advisors.
</p>
<p>
  There was strong energy and excitement at the conference about the government's 
  ability to push forward on the state of the art, launching a production API 
  service in 2018 for the entire Medicare fee-for-service population, and 
  unlocking any number of downstream use cases. I was delighted for the 
  chance to attend and to participate in two ways. First, I had the opportunity 
  to present an overview of the Sync for Science project, which helps patients 
  share health data with researchers. And second, to participate in Microsoft's 
  joint announcement Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, and Salesforce committing to 
  removing barriers for the adoption of technologies for healthcare 
  interoperability. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Partnership announcement</h2>
<p>
On that subject... half a dozen of the biggest names in technology – Amazon, Google, 
Microsoft, Salesforce, IBM, and Oracle – joined together to pledge speedy progress 
towards true health data interoperability. This was associated with the CMS Developer 
Conference  (see above). See <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/amazon-google-ibm-pledge-health-data-standards-interoperability">write up</a>.
</p>
<p>
For further commentary, see <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/industry-blog/industry/health/microsoft-amazon-google-and-ibm-issue-joint-statement-for-healthcare-interoperability/">Josh's blog</a>:
</p>
<p>
Quoting from this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
 Open standards, open specifications, and open source tools are essential 
 to facilitate frictionless data exchange. This requires a variety of 
 technical strategies and ongoing collaboration for the industry to converge 
 and embrace emerging standards for healthcare data interoperability, such 
 as HL7 FHIR and the Argonaut Project. 
</p>
<p>
 We understand that achieving frictionless health data exchange is an 
 ongoing process, and we commit to actively engaging among open source 
 and open standards communities for the development of healthcare 
 standards, and conformity assessment to foster agility to account 
 for the accelerated pace of innovation. 
</p>
<p>
 Together, we believe that a robust industry dialogue about healthcare 
 interoperability needs will advance this cause, and hence are pleased 
 to issue this joint statement.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As you'll notice, this announcement has no specific deliverables - I think that's good. 
There is a call for dialogue - that's a great opportunity for our community - if you 
have an opinion about how this group could match  the accomplishments and impact of 
the Argonaut community - feel free to join discussion here:

<h2>The Gartner curve</h2>
</p>
We commonly get asked about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">Gartner Hype Cycle</a> - where is FHIR 
on the hype cycle?
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Gartner_Hype_Cycle.svg/480px-Gartner_Hype_Cycle.svg.png"/>
</p>
<p>
For a while, it was clear that the answer was: we're on the first part the curve, and 
hype is flying into the stratosphere (well, compared with our initial expectations). 
But in the last year or so that hasn't really been the case. I routinely survey FHIR 
implementers informally when I'm speaking about this, and we're starting to get 
non-trivial numbers of people voting that we're on the 'slope of enlightment'.
</p>
<p>
If we really are (if), then that's great because it means that the trough has been 
relatively shallow, which was always our priority: to ensure that the quality of the 
specification and the community meant that FHIR was ready for real use.
</p>
<p>
The "(if)" part is because the interesting thing about FHIR is that it has such a broad 
impact, and different parts of the specification & community are in different places in 
the cycle. There's some very clear regards in which FHIR is still just hype (where's the 
FHIR bus in healthcare provider institutions - only a very few have one right now). Our 
challenge is to grow the community and infrastructure base with solid fundamentals so that 
each individual area of work has as shallow a trough as possible.
</p>

<h2>Foundation issues </h2>
<p>
The HL7 board has asked the FHIR Foundation board to review the relationship between HL7 
and the FHIR foundation. I'll prepare a separate brief for FHIR Foundation members about 
this, seeking your opinions.
